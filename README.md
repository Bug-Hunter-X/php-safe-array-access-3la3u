# PHP Silent Data Processing Error

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a PHP data processing function. The function `processData` silently ignores array entries that are missing expected keys ('id' and 'value') instead of providing informative feedback or handling the error appropriately.

The `bug.php` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description
The `processData` function is designed to transform an array of arrays into a keyed array.  However, if an input array is missing the 'id' or 'value' keys, it silently logs the issue with `error_log` and continues, leading to incomplete or inaccurate results.

## Solution
The improved solution in `bugSolution.php` uses exceptions for better error handling. This allows for more controlled error handling and prevents unexpected results due to missing data.
